## We’ve come now to the end of the high-level overview of a Rails application. The toy app developed in this chapter has several strengths and a host of weaknesses.

### Strengths

* High-level overview of Rails
* Introduction to MVC
* First taste of the REST architecture
* Beginning data modeling
* A live, database-backed web application in production

### Weaknesses

* No custom layout or styling
* No static pages (such as “Home” or “About”)
* No user passwords
* No user images
* No logging in
* No security
* No automatic user/micropost association
* No notion of “following” or “followed”
* No micropost feed
* No meaningful tests
* No real understanding
* The rest of this tutorial is dedicated to building on the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses.
